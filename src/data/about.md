# Intro

One day, I realized that genuine, unique photography has the power to stir emotions, and I yearned to share these emotions with others and awaken them through my work. The moment I acquired my first camera, my perspective on the world changed. I started seeing things in frames, light, and shadows. 

In photography, what holds utmost importance to me is capturing truth and beauty, ensuring that my work imparts as much delight to viewers as I experienced in its creation.

I am currently living in Calgary with my beloved man and our two little blessings. We dream big of waking up every morning to the soothing melodies of the nearby river, surrounded by the tranquility of nature, nurturing our own garden, tending to a few adorable chickens and goats, and crafting  homemade beverages.

My portfolio encompasses a range of photography, including advertising sessions, engagement reportages, and family and portrait sessions. If you're interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
