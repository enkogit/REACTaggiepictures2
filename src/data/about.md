One day, I came to realize that authentic, unique photography has the power to evoke deep emotions, and I felt a strong desire to share those feelings with others, awakening them through my work. The moment I picked up my first camera, my perspective on the world transformed. I began seeing everything through frames, light, and shadows. For me, the most important aspects of photography are capturing beauty and truth, ensuring that my work brings as much joy to viewers as I experienced in creating it.

Currently, I split my time between Lumberton, South Texas, and my home in Mountain View County, Alberta. Here, my family and I are building our dream, waking up to the melodies of a nearby river, surrounded by the serenity of nature, growing our own garden, caring for a few chickens and goats, and crafting homemade beverages
